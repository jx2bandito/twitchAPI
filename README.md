# Twitch Viewer<br />


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a Twitch.tv viewer. It lists streamers and indicates whether they are offline or online.
Like the Wikipedia Viewer, its main purpose was to teach how to use JSON API. I realize that including an API Key
in JavaScript is bad practice, but for the purpose of this exercise it was deemed acceptable by the curriculum.
